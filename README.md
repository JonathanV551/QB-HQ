# QB HQ 🏈📊

QB HQ is a data-driven football analytics project focused on evaluating **NFL quarterback performance** using advanced statistics, contextual team metrics, and matchup-based analysis.

The goal of this project is to go beyond surface-level stats (yards, TDs, passer rating) and analyze how quarterbacks perform relative to **defensive strength, game context, and efficiency metrics**.

- Analyze NFL QB performance using modern data science techniques  
- Incorporate **opposing defensive metrics** to contextualize QB outcomes  
- Identify trends, inefficiencies, and matchup advantages  
- Build a foundation for predictive modeling and deeper football analytics
